# LorenzAtractor
A small view of one of the most famous chaos system: The Butterfly effect. 
Tank you to @shiffman (best coding teacher ever) and the p5.js library I solved and illustrated the solution of The Lorenz Attractor differential equations system.

In the link below you can visualize the solution of the Lorenz Attractor https://editor.p5js.org/josefoD/sketches/SyUjADEYm. You can use the mouse pad to rotate the view, just click, hold and move and also you can zoom in and zoom out.
